            <h3>AIRON</h3>

            <p>The AIRON offered as a part of the Criminal Recognition system is the backbone for the Security systems
                at Airport. The system is brought down to bare specifics. Each Criminal detail is carefully recorded
                with all the information necessary by National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB). Face recognition is a
                personal identification system that uses personal characteristics such as eyes, nose and mouth and Shape
                of the face of a person to identify the person's identity. Human face recognition procedure basically
                consists of two phases, The detection stage is the first stage; it includes identifying and locating a
                face in an image. The recognition stage is the second stage; it includes feature extraction, where
                important information for discrimination is saved, and the matching, where the recognition result is
                given with the aid of a face database. It has been found that manual identification of the Face
                Recognition and detection whether the person is criminal or not is inaccurate many times cause the
                Security Personnel is Checking thousands of persons every day so it’s creating some Cognitive bias but
                the facial recognition systems used at airports can accurate 85% most of the time. The best thing about
                this AIRON is that it is designed specifically with the criminal dataset so it learns about them every
                day with the increasing database of criminal without being Biased.</p>
